# 🚲 Bike Rental Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Bike Rental System** built to analyze, manage, and visualize bike rental data.  
The system helps understand rental patterns, customer behavior, and demand trends using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques.  

It includes:
- ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- ✅ Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis
- ✅ Data Visualization (graphs & charts)
- ✅ Business Insights for better decision making

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about **bike rentals** including:
- Date & Time of rental
- Season & Weather conditions
- Temperature & Humidity
- Number of bikes rented (hourly/daily)
- Other influencing factors

*(If dataset is external, mention source: e.g., [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset))*

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (Numerical analysis)
- **Matplotlib** (Visualization)
- **Seaborn** (Advanced plots)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
### 🔹 Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of bike rentals per hour/day
- Seasonal and monthly usage patterns
- Effect of weather on rentals

### 🔹 Bivariate Analysis
- Temperature vs Bike Rentals
- Humidity vs Bike Rentals
- Weather condition vs Rentals

### 🔹 Multivariate Analysis
- Combined effect of Temperature, Humidity, and Season on rentals
- Correlation Heatmap
- Pairplots & 3D Scatter plots
